# 🌐 Customer Client Satisfaction Survey Portal

## 📝 Description

This is a responsive web portal designed to direct users to client satisfaction surveys for internal and external services. It provides a clean, mobile-friendly interface with subtle animations and background imagery to enhance user experience. The goal is to offer a seamless and professional way for users to access survey links on any device.

The landing page includes:
* A centered layout with fade-in and slide-up animations
* Background image located at images/tapi_bldg.jpg
* Responsive design with media queries for mobile and tablet
* Two large clickable buttons with individual background images:
  - images/internal.png for Internal Service
  - images/external.png for External Service
* Buttons feature grayscale-to-color hover effects and text overlays
* Container uses a semi-transparent background without affecting its contents
* Text content is preserved above background images for accessibility
